# Homeworks






##1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?

# elevate efficiency and do not impact other parts of code

##2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?
# To define, def rere(): 
# To execute, rere()


3. What statement creates a function?
# To define, def rere(): 
# To execute, rere()


4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
# To define, def rere(): 
# To execute, rere()


5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
# 1 and 1
# There is one global scope, and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
# the variable has been destroyed


7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?
# evaluate
# no


8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
#None


9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?
# Global variable name


10. What is the data type of None?
# The data type of None is NoneType.


11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?
# import module


12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
# spam.bacon()


13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?
# Try:
# Except:


14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?
##The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause.
##The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause.
