1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True False



2. What are the three Boolean operators?
and, or, not


3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

True and True True
True and False False
False and True False
False and False False

True or True True
True or False True
False or True True
False or False False

True not False
False not True



4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?


(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) 
False

not (5 > 4)
False

(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
True

not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
False

(True and True) and (True == False)
False

(not False) or (not True)
True



5. What are the six comparison operators?
== > < != >= <=


6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
== equal = assignment



7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
if 



8. Identify the three blocks in this code:


spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')            
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')        
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')


9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

print('Please enter')

spam=input()

if int(spam)==1:
    print('Hello')
elif int(spam)==2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')





10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

ctrl + c


11. What is the difference between break and continue?
break: out of the loop and go to the next step of program flow
continue: go back to the original conidtion



12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
no difference



13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. 
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(1,11,1):
    print(i)

i=1
while i <11:
    print(i)
    i=i+1
    



14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
spam.bacon()
